# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method? 7/10 i had to google a lot of the answers but was able to find it and understand how it works.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle? I felt lost at first but very accomplished when you find the correct search term and being able to apply it to the code.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? Understanding that we can use If statements in these each method. I got stuck a lot of times because of it. Just remembering we can use other codes from previous lesson and now stuck on just "this lesson"
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Nothing as of right now.
